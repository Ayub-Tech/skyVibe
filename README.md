SkyVibe
SkyVibe is a modern weather application that provides up-to-date weather information and 7-day forecasts. With a simple and intuitive design, users can easily check the current weather conditions for their location, as well as view forecasts for the upcoming days.

Project Overview
The goal of SkyVibe is to create an easy-to-use weather app that allows users to check the current weather in their location and view a detailed 7-day forecast. Users will also have access to automatic updates for the weather data, with clear error handling in case of issues. The project ensures a smooth user experience with a user-friendly interface and displays accurate weather information at all times.

Functional Requirements
Current Weather Display:

The system should display the current weather conditions (temperature, weather description, and location) in real-time.
7-Day Weather Forecast:

The app should display a 7-day weather forecast, with temperatures and weather descriptions for each day.
Automatic Weather Update:

Weather data should automatically update to ensure users always see the most current information.
Error Handling:

If the weather data cannot be retrieved, the app should display an error message to inform the user.
Location Access:

The app should be able to retrieve the user's location to show relevant weather information, or the user should be able to manually search for a location.
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The weather data should update without delay, providing users with accurate, real-time information at all times.
Security:

The app must ensure that user settings (location or preferences) are stored securely, even though sensitive personal data is not processed.
Usability:

The user interface must be intuitive, with easy navigation and interaction, allowing users to access weather information quickly.
Compatibility and Accessibility:

The app should be responsive and accessible across different platforms and screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Reliability:

The app should be available to users with minimal downtime (99.9% uptime).
